## Purpose Of Project
The goal of this project is to explore and consolidate my understandings of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project requires to replicate the layout and format of a design/image using CSS, add content via HTML and control the interactive elements via JavaScript

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript

## Requirements
### HTML/SCSS
- Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport
- Minimum 3 icons on desktop
- The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
- Apps look consistent
- Menu contains a flex with content inside it
- Apps should be able to contain text, an image or a form

### JavaScript
- Put your js code into separate files
- Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
- Give your functions and variables good names
- Use the arrow syntax to declare functions

- The Notes app also has delete function shown as a bin icon, a save function shown as a disk icon and a create new note function shown as a pencil and paper icon on the top. When clicking on an existing note on the left side, clicking on the bin icon will delete it. When click the create new notes icon, the note title and content will be empty for creating new note, the background color for the active note on the left will also disappear. And when creating new note, clicking the save icon will save it to the left side notes list

## Known Issues  
 The Finder app and Photos app don't have actual functionalities right now

## Future Goals

- Add funtionality to Finder app, so that when clicking on a file/folder, a fake file/folder will be opened
- Add funtionality to Photos app, so that when clicking on photo icon, the photo will be opened and shown with a proper size
